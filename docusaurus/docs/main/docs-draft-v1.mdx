# Eth-Hooks V4 Documentation

Speed up your blockchain project.

Build a React frontend fast with the help of Eth-hooks.

Read and write to smart contracts using pre-built hooks designed to work with [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) and context.

_These docs are for developers who are already familiar with the basics of [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/)._

Eth-hooks is part of the [Scaffold-Eth ecosystem](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/).

## Key features of V4

- Designed for easy use without a need to understand what's under the hood
- Choose how often a hook receives updates from the network
- Easily use context with ethers and contracts
- Typed contracts that make it easier to understand the contract interface
- Allows different ways to pass in ethers provider or secondary providers
- Network RPC calls are cached stopping unnecessary requests to the network
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) friendly
- We use an [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)

### Quick start

1. Create a React app
2. Connect your app to your smart contracts.
3. Install Eth-hooks in your React app root folder by entering the following in your terminal

```bash
yarn add eth-hooks
```

4. Setup context in your React app index.js file

```javascript
<ContractsAppContext>
  <EthersAppContext>
    <App />
  </EthersAppContext>
</ContractsAppContext>
```

5. If you're using providers, here's an example of how they sould look in your App.js file

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <ContractsAppContext>
      <EthersAppContext>
        <ThemeSwitcherProvider>
          <MainPage />
        </ThemeSwitcherProvider>
      </EthersAppContext>
    </ContractsAppContext>
  );
}
export default App;
```

Now you can use any Eth-hook you need anywhere in your application.

### Design principles

- Allows flexibility in how often a hook receives updates from the network. You can choose your update method, for example, polling or every block number.
- Easily use context
  - **ethersAppContext**
  - **contractAppContext** (new in V4): Access your contract easily anywhere in your app.
- Compatibility with different ways to pass in ethers provider
- Reducing RPC calls with easy caching. Uses React Query under the hood to cache any RPC calls. This lets you use Eth-hooks anywhere in the app and you don't have to worry about optimization. You will automatically get data from the cached layer without extra network calls.
- Typed contracts that make it easier to understand the contract interface, reducing mistakes.

#### Providers

- EthersAppContext: The context in Eth-hooks uses ethers under-the-hood. Wrap your main app in context and that allows you to use context anywhere in your app (the provider, signer, account).
  - App wide providers with context
  - Override
    - Alternate context for web3-react
    - Pass in provider if you need

#### Cache

Built with React-Query and EthersContext. Get a cache when you wrap your app in context.

- All hook results are cached by EthersContext
  - Prevents repeated calls to the network because the hooks hit the cache first.
  - No need to pass variables. If you use a hook anywhere in the app it will automatically hit the cache.
  - When the network or signer changes the cache is automatically invalidated so you don't get the wrong values.

#### Data updates

- There are several different options for updating hook data. Simply pass in your preferred update method.
  - **Default** is the hook updates every block
  - You can set it to update every n/blocks
  - Polling can be used (minimum time is 10 seconds to prevent spamming the network)
  - Refresh on window focus or on mount
  - Set stale time for data. Default is 30 seconds

#### Hook return

The signature of the hook is returned.

- This is similar to useState. You get a tuple of [result, update]
  - Gives you the result or...
  - You can manually update the hook

#### Contract context

You can call any contract with a simple hook.

- Automatically get external contracts that are verified
  - Automatically typed by context
- Hardhat contracts
  - Automatically typed by context
- Load unverified contracts from an ABI
  - BaseContract
